## 📌 Project Overview

Time series forecasting is a crucial task in data science for predicting future trends based on historical data. In this project, we:

- Load and visualize time series data
- Engineer lag features
- Prepare the dataset for supervised learning
- Split the data into training and testing sets
- Train an XGBoost regression model
- Evaluate forecasting accuracy using RMSE
- Plot predictions vs actual values
